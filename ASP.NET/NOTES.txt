	- Controller = connects models, business logic, and web pages. 
	- MVC design pattern helps to enforce separation of concerns to help you avoid mixing presentation logic, business logic, and data access logic together.
		- File sizes are smaller, code is modulr, can be run and managed by multiple people.

	- ORM: Object Relation Mapper: Ex) Between a class and a table
		- More automated. Allows the computer to generate database tables based on classes defined in the application. 
		- Database updated using migrations
		- Don't really need to use SQL statements. 
		- Entity Framework is Microsofts ORM
