Just a quick update on the Pylint library. To see the same report that I do in the video, in the newest version of PyLint you need to add -r y (report yes) at the end of the command, so the full command should be:

pylint myexample.py -r y

If you check out the video I only wrote pylint myexample.py , you will need to add on -r y
