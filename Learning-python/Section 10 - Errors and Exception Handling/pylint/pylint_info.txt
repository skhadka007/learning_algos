HOW TO: python -m pylint test.py 	[Pylint module]
	python -m MODULE FILE.py	[For any python module]
-------------------------------------------------
Just a quick update on the Pylint library. To see the same report that I do in the video, in the newest version of PyLint you need to add -r y (report yes) at the end of the command, so the full command should be:

pylint myexample.py -r y [DOESNT WORK]

python -m pylint test.py [WORKS!!!]
-------------------------------------------------
- pylint: Library that looks at your code and reports back possible issues.
- unittest: Built-in library that allows you to test your own programs and check you are getting desired outputs. 

- PEP 8: Pythons style convention rules.

"any python module can be run with python -m MODULE for instance I always use python3 -m pip since I can never manage to get the pip alias to work for the correct version ðŸ˜‹. so you can use pylint as: python -m pylint test.py"
